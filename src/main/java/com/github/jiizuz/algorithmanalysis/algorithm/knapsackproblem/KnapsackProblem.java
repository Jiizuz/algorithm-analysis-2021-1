/**
 * The knapsack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given
 * a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number
 * of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is
 * less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as
 * possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is
 * constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most
 * valuable items. The problem often arises in resource allocation where
 * the decision makers have to choose from a set of non-divisible projects
 * or tasks under a fixed budget or time constraint, respectively.
 *
 * <p>The knapsack problem has been studied for more than a century, with
 * early works dating as far back as 1897. The name "knapsack problem" dates
 * back to the early works of the mathematician Tobias Dantzig (1884â€“1956),
 * and refers to the commonplace problem of packing the most valuable or
 * useful items without overloading the luggage.
