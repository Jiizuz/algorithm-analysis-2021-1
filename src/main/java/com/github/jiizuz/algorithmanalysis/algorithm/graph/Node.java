/**
 * In mathematics, and more specifically in graph theory, a <b>vertex</b>
 * (plural <b>vertices</b>) or <b>node</b> is the fundamental unit of
 * which graphs are formed: an undirected graph consists of a set of
 * vertices and a set of edges (unordered pairs of vertices), while a
 * directed graph consists of a set of vertices and a set of arcs (ordered
 * pairs of vertices). In a diagram of a graph, a vertex is usually
 * represented by a circle with a label, and an edge is represented by a
 * line or arrow extending from one vertex to another.
 * <p>
 * From the point of view of graph theory, vertices are treated as
 * featureless and indivisible objects, although they may have additional
 * structure depending on the application from which the graph arises;
 * for instance, a semantic network is a graph in which the vertices
 * represent concepts or classes of objects.
 * <p>
 * The two vertices forming an edge are said to be the endpoints of this
 * edge, and the edge is said to be incident to the vertices. A vertex
 * <i>w</i> is said to be adjacent to another vertex <i>v</i> if the graph
 * contains an edge (<i>v,w</i>). The neighborhood of a vertex <i>v</i> is
 * an induced subgraph of the graph, formed by all vertices adjacent to
 * <i>v</i>.
 *
 * <p>A {@link Node} is {@link Comparable} based on its {@code Id}.
